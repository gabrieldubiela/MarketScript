# Overview

This project aims to analyze and forecast the performance of different assets over a 10-year period. The goal is to provide insights into the historical growth and future growth potential of these assets. The project uses a combination of historical data and linear regression models to make predictions.

The data set used in this project is obtained from various sources, including Yahoo Finance and the Brazilian Central Bank (BCB). The data includes historical prices, interest rates, and inflation rates for different assets such as the Brazilian stock market (IBOV), the US stock market (SPX), Bitcoin, the Federal Reserve interest rate (FED), the Brazilian interest rate (SELIC), and the Brazilian inflation rate (IPCA).

The purpose of this software is to analyze the historical performance of these assets and make predictions for the next 10 years. The software uses linear regression models to forecast the future growth of each asset based on historical data.
